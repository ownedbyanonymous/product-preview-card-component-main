## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge taught me how to develop better and faster using the mobile-first workflow. Also this challenge presented an opportunity to use optimized assests for different device sizes for faster loading times and better user experience.

        <source media="(media-query2)" srcset="image-path">
        <img src="image-path" alt="alt-text/>
    </picture>
```
